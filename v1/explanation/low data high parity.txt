## Case :> 1:3 [Normal Scenario]

with increase of data parity expantion time taken reduced 
with increase and data , parity size 
 shows uniform across cases.



## Case:> 1:4
Inconsistet behaviour as well 
similar to 1:2 for 
[filesize: 200MB]
total = 2:8 [10] -> 6.44 seconds, 3:12 [15] -> 8.66 seconds

Another Case 
[filesize: 800 MB]
3:12 -> 19 seconds  2:8  -> 17 seconds
